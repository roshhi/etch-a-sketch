# Etch-A-Sketch
So as you know im diving deep in JS so instead of just following tutorials, i decided make this from scratch to get a really good grip on JS. (Thanks to TheOdinProject)
Its basically a coloring board where when you move your mouse, it draws! 

Wish me LUCK to complete the whole OdinProject :)
